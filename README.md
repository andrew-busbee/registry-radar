- üé® **Easy-to-Use Interface**: Clean, modern web interface that anyone can use
- üì± **Instant Notifications**: See update notifications right in your browser
- üìä **Dashboard View**: Get an overview of all your images and their update status
- ‚öôÔ∏è **No Database Needed**: Everything is stored in simple files - no complex setup required
- üê≥ **Docker Ready**: Runs in Docker with just one command
- üéâ **Application Notifications**: Notifications from the app are available via Apprise (Discord, Slack, Email, SMS, and 80+ other services) 

## Getting Started

The easiest way to run Registry Radar is with Docker Compose. You'll be up and running in just a few minutes!

### Option 1: Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

1. **Create a docker-compose.yml with the following content:** 
```yml
services:
  registry-radar:
    image: ghcr.io/andrewbusbee/registry-radar:0.1.0-beta.8 # Tag will become latest when released
    container_name: registry-radar
    ports:
      - "3001:3001"
    volumes:
      - data:/app/data
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - PORT=3001
      - APPRISE_URL=http://apprise:8000
      # Public URL (required for registry radar agent use)
      # Set your public Registry Radar URL or internal IP:PORT 
      - REGISTRY_RADAR_URL=https://registry-radar.your-domain.com or http://IP:PORT
      # Docker Hub Authentication (optional)
      # Increases rate limit from 100 to 200 pulls/6hr (or unlimited with Pro account)
      # Uncomment and set your credentials to enable:
      # - DOCKERHUB_USERNAME=your_username
      # - DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD=your_password_or_token
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - registry-radar-network

  apprise:
    image: caronc/apprise:latest
    container_name: apprise
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - APPRISE_ALLOW_HOSTS=registry-radar # Only allow connections from registry-radar container
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - registry-radar-network

volumes:
  data:

networks:
  registry-radar-network:
    driver: bridge
    name: registry-radar-network
```

2. **Start Registry Radar:**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

3. **Open your browser:**
Go to `http://localhost:3001` and you'll see the Registry Radar interface.

That's it! Registry Radar is now running and ready to monitor images for you!

### üîê Default Login Credentials

**First Time Setup:**
- **Username:** `user`
- **Password:** `password`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Note:** You will be required to change these default credentials on your first login. The system will prompt you to create a new username and password that are more secure.

**After First Login:**
- Use your new credentials to access Registry Radar
- You can change your credentials anytime in Settings ‚Üí Authentication

### Option 2: Using Docker CLI

If you prefer to use Docker commands directly:

```bash
# Create named volume
docker volume create data

# Create custom network
docker network create registry-radar-network

# Run apprise container
docker run -d \
  --name apprise \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --network registry-radar-network \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -e APPRISE_ALLOW_HOSTS=registry-radar \
  caronc/apprise:latest

# Run registry-radar container
docker run -d \
  --name registry-radar \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --network registry-radar-network \
  -p 3001:3001 \
  -v data:/app/data \
  -e NODE_ENV=production \
  -e PORT=3001 \
  -e APPRISE_URL=http://apprise:8000 \
  -e REGISTRY_RADAR_URL=https://registry-radar.your-domain.com or http://IP:PORT \
  ghcr.io/andrewbusbee/registry-radar:0.1.0-beta.8

```

Then open `http://localhost:3001` in your browser.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note:**
Registry Radar doesn't have built-in user authentication yet. If you're planning to use it in a production environment where others might access it, consider:
- Using a reverse proxy with authentication (like nginx with basic auth)
- Restricting network access with a firewall
- Running it on a private network or VPN

## How to Use Registry Radar

Once Registry Radar is running, you can start adding images to monitor. The web interface makes this easy - just click "Add Image" and fill in the details or paste in a list of conatiners to monitor.

### Setting Up Automatic Checks

Registry Radar can automatically check for updates on a schedule. By default, it checks daily at 9 AM, but you can change this:

- **Through the Web Interface**: Go to Settings ‚Üí Cron Configuration

Example schedule configurations:
```yaml
# Check daily at 9 AM (default)
schedule: "0 9 * * *"

# Check every 6 hours
schedule: "0 */6 * * *"

# Check weekly on Monday at 8 AM
schedule: "0 8 * * 1"
```

## Notification Options

Registry Radar can send you notifications when updated images are found or errors occur. You can configure multiple notification types to stay informed about your Docker images.

### Available Notification Types
#### üîî **Apprise Notifications**
Send notifications to 80+ services including Discord, Slack, Email, SMS, Pushover, and many more. Apprise provides a unified interface for all your notification needs.

**Setup:**
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Notifications in the web interface
2. Enable Apprise notifications
3. Add notification channels using Apprise URLs
4. Test your configuration

**Supported Services Include:**
- **Discord**: `discord://webhook_id/webhook_token`

```

### Testing Your Notifications

After setting up notifications, you can test them:
- **Apprise**: Click "Send Test Notification" in the notification settings

### Environment Variables

You can customize Registry Radar with these environment variables:
- `PORT` - The port to run on (default: 3001)
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to 'development' or 'production'
- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` - Your Docker Hub username (optional, increases rate limits)
- `DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD` - Your Docker Hub password/token (optional)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Registry Radar won't start:**
- Check if port 3001 is already in use: `docker ps` or `netstat -tulpn | grep 3001`
- Make sure Docker is running: `docker --version`

**Can't access the web interface:**
- Verify the container is running: `docker-compose ps`
- Check the logs: `docker-compose logs registry-radar`
- Try accessing `http://localhost:3001` (not https)

**Image checks are failing:**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify image names and tags are correct
- For GitHub images, make sure you've specified the namespace

### Getting Help

If you run into issues:
1. Check the Registy Radar container logs: `docker-compose logs registry-radar`
2. Look at the web interface - it often shows helpful error messages
3. Create an issue on GitHub with your error details
