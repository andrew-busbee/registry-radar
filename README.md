## Getting Started

The easiest way to run Registry Radar is with Docker Compose. You'll be up and running in just a few minutes!

### Option 1: Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

1. **Create a docker-compose.yml with the following content:** The [sample docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/andrewbusbee/registry-radar/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file also has an optional healthcheck.
```yml
services:
  registry-radar:
    image: ghcr.io/andrewbusbee/registry-radar:0.1.0-beta.5 # Tag will become latest when released
    container_name: registry-radar
    ports:
      - "3001:3001"
    volumes:
      - data:/app/data
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - PORT=3001
      - APPRISE_URL=http://apprise:8000
      # Docker Hub Authentication (optional)
      # Increases rate limit from 100 to 200 pulls/6hr (or unlimited with Pro account)
      # Uncomment and set your credentials to enable:
      # - DOCKERHUB_USERNAME=your_username
      # - DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD=your_password_or_token
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - registry-radar-network

  apprise:
    image: caronc/apprise:latest
    container_name: apprise
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - APPRISE_ALLOW_HOSTS=registry-radar # Only allow connections from registry-radar container
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - registry-radar-network

volumes:
  data:

networks:
  registry-radar-network:
    driver: bridge
    name: registry-radar-network
```

2. **Start Registry Radar:**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

3. **Open your browser:**
Go to `http://localhost:3001` and you'll see the Registry Radar interface.

That's it! Registry Radar is now running and ready to monitor your containers.

### Option 2: Using Docker CLI

If you prefer to use Docker commands directly:

```bash
# Create named volume
docker volume create data

# Create custom network
docker network create registry-radar-network

# Run apprise container
docker run -d \
  --name apprise \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --network registry-radar-network \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -e APPRISE_ALLOW_HOSTS=registry-radar \
  caronc/apprise:latest

# Run registry-radar container
docker run -d \
  --name registry-radar \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --network registry-radar-network \
  -p 3001:3001 \
  -v data:/app/data \
  -e NODE_ENV=production \
  -e PORT=3001 \
  -e APPRISE_URL=http://apprise:8000 \
  ghcr.io/andrewbusbee/registry-radar:0.1.0-beta.5

```

Then open `http://localhost:3001` in your browser.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note:**
Registry Radar doesn't have built-in user authentication yet. If you're planning to use it in a production environment where others might access it, consider:
- Using a reverse proxy with authentication (like nginx with basic auth)
- Restricting network access with a firewall
- Running it on a private network or VPN

## How to Use Registry Radar

Once Registry Radar is running, you can start adding containers to monitor. The web interface makes this easy - just click "Add Container" and fill in the details or paste in a list of conatiners to monitor.

### Setting Up Automatic Checks

Registry Radar can automatically check for updates on a schedule. By default, it checks daily at 9 AM, but you can change this:

- **Through the Web Interface**: Go to Settings ‚Üí Cron Configuration

Example schedule configurations:
```yaml
# Check daily at 9 AM (default)
schedule: "0 9 * * *"

# Check every 6 hours
schedule: "0 */6 * * *"

# Check weekly on Monday at 8 AM
schedule: "0 8 * * 1"
```

### Environment Variables

You can customize Registry Radar with these environment variables:
- `PORT` - The port to run on (default: 3001)
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to 'development' or 'production'
- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` - Your Docker Hub username (optional, increases rate limits)
- `DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD` - Your Docker Hub password/token (optional)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Registry Radar won't start:**
- Check if port 3001 is already in use: `docker ps` or `netstat -tulpn | grep 3001`
- Make sure Docker is running: `docker --version`

**Can't access the web interface:**
- Verify the container is running: `docker-compose ps`
- Check the logs: `docker-compose logs registry-radar`
- Try accessing `http://localhost:3001` (not https)

**Container checks are failing:**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify container names and tags are correct
- For GitHub containers, make sure you've specified the namespace

### Getting Help

If you run into issues:
1. Check the container logs: `docker-compose logs registry-radar`
2. Look at the web interface - it often shows helpful error messages
3. Create an issue on GitHub with your error details
